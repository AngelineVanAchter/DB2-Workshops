# Workshop - Temporary Tables
In this workshop you'll learn how to create and use a temporary table.

## Prerequisites
- A running copy of database **xtreme**;
- Finalised the exercises about stored procedures and cursors.

## Introduction
In the [previous workshop about cursors](/workshops/cursors.md), you wrote a stored procedure to delete all orders and orderdetails for a given supplier called `DeleteOrdersFromSupplier`, the output parameter/return value of this stored procedure was the number of deleted orders and orderdetails. However there are always alternative approaches. This time we'll use a temporarly table to delete all the orders for a given supplier.

## Call to action
- Adjust the stored procedure to delete all `orders` and `orderdetails` for a given `supplierId` using a `temporarly table`.
- Return the number of deleted `orders` **and** the number of deleted `orderdetails`;
- Additionally, throw an exception if the given supplier doesnâ€™t exist.

## Execution
Make sure the following code can be executed:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION

BEGIN TRY
    DECLARE @amountOfOrders int, @amountOfOrdersDetails int

    EXEC DeleteOrdersFromSupplier3 5,@amountOfOrders OUT, @amountOfOrdersDetails OUT

    PRINT 'Amount of deleted orders = ' + str(@amountOfOrders)
    PRINT 'Amount of deleted orderdetails = ' + str(@amountOfOrdersDetails)

END TRY

BEGIN CATCH
PRINT 'Oops: error ''' + error_message() + ''' in procedure ' + error_procedure() + ' at line ' + cast(error_line() as varchar)
END CATCH

ROLLBACK;
```

## Tips
- Check if the supplier exists
- Create a temp. table for the orders.
- Insert all orders from the supplier into the temp. table;
- Delete all orderdetails for all orders in the temp. table;
- Delete all orders based on the temp. table; 
- Don't forget to set the OUTPUT values.
